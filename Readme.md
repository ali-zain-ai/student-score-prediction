# Student Performance Factor Prediction 🎓

This project aims to predict student academic performance (scores) based on various factors such as study hours, attendance, parental involvement, and more. It uses Machine Learning to identify the key drivers of student success.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal is to provide insights into how different environmental and behavioral factors impact a student's final score. This can help educators and parents focus on the areas that matter most.

## 📁 Project Structure
* **App/**: Contains the deployment files (Streamlit/Flask).
* **Data/**: Raw and processed datasets.
* **Notebooks/**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Training (`model.ipynb`).
* **requirements.txt**: List of libraries needed to run the project.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
